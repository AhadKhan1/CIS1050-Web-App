        <h2 style="font-size: 40px;">What action will be initiated after payment?</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">You will be readdressed to our website, where you will go through a quick process of account registration. 
            Thereafter, you will be adressed to our customer area, where you will have to provide your valorant login details. Meanwhile your order will be open to claim for any of our coaches. 
            When the coach confirms an order, the coaching process starts. Generallly, this process doesn't take more than 5-10 minutes.</p>

    <article>
        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Who will provide coaching?</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">I will provide one on one coaching services but as this expands we will look to hire players who play
        at a very high level. We screen each and every candidate to ensure they really achieved the required ranks. Moreover, we 
        absolutely disapprove any toxic behavior and the coaches, who maintain such an activity, lose their place on our service without delay. We also 
        value the privacy of our clients, hence chatting with client's friends without notifying him is strictly prohibited.</p>

  <article>
    <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Can you tell me about your refund policy?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">We are always ready to make a full refund if the order has not been started yet and you for whatever reason have decided to give up our service. 
        If we already started coaching services for your rank, we will be able to calculate a full refund. We do not require money that we don't own.</p>

<article>
    <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">In what ways should I contact you if I need support?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">Our support service works mainly through email as of right now but we will soon implement a facebook messenger function to make contacting support much faster. 
        Our support service works 7 days a week. Generally, we respond any time soon, however the time period may vary from a few minutes to 12 hours. 
        It depends on the workload of our support service at the moment.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">To give an idea of what each character does</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">The first character on the left, is named "Phoenix". He is a character who tries to take one-on-one duels to allow his team
    to push onto sites. His abilities allow him to flash certain areas on the map in order to clear it out from enemies, throw a molotov to halt any pushes, a fire wall to block vision
  and lastly an ultimate ability that gives him a second chance!</p>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">The second character, is named "Reyna". She is a character who works similar to Phoenix in the sense that she makes space for 
    her team to push onto enemy sites. Her abilities are a bit different but still allow her to flash certain areas on the map in order to clear it out from enemies, turn invisible for a few seconds, suck on slain souls to gain more health and lastly,
    an ultimate that gives her fast shooting speeds and the ability to go invincible again!</p>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Our last character, is named "Killjoy". She is a character who works a lot different compared to the other two. Killjoy is a defensive expert who can
      lock down areas on the map and watch flanks. Her abilities allow her to set alarm bots that trigger upon enemy movement, activatable grenades, a turret that fires automatically at enemies
      and finally, her ultimate which locksdown a portion of the map detaining any enemies within it.</p>

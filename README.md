# CIS1050-Web-App

This is the final web app project I made in the course CIS 1050. Mainly coded through HTML/CSS

Our final web project was primarily focused on selecting a topic and developing a fully functional website using barebones HTML/CSS. I ended up selecting a topic that I am very interested in and passionate about which is playing a game called "Valorant"
